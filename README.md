### What is RFM Analysis?
RFM analysis is a technique for categorizing customers based on their purchasing behavior. This segmentation method allows marketing teams to target customers with personalized marketing campaigns. Instead of analyzing the entire customer base as a whole, it's better to segment them into homogenous groups, understand the traits of each group, and engage them with relevant campaigns.

RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value. That means we have to use these metrics in order to perform this method. So what are these values?
* Recency : The freshness of customer activity. It's the time difference between the last purchase date of the customer and the date of analysis.
* Frequency : The frequency of the customer transaction, means a total number of transactions.
* Monetary : Sum of each purchase that has been made by each customer.
